# Mini Games Studio

Mini Games Studio lets you build 30-second web games and share them directly in the Farcaster feed. Games are generated by AI and can be tokenized so your community can back their favorites.

## Getting Started

1. Visit Mini Games Studio and sign in with your Farcaster account.
2. Describe your idea on the home page and click **Build Game**.
3. Use the chat to tweak the gameplay until it feels right.
4. When you're happy, click **Publish** to mint a token and share your game.
5. Need to go back? Open the **Version History** sidebar on the build page to restore or remove previous versions.

See the [Creator Docs](/docs) for more tips on writing prompts and managing your tokens.
