# Profile Page Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created a complete profile page system for users based on their wallet address. The implementation follows modern Next.js 15 App Router patterns and integrates seamlessly with your existing Mini Games Studio application.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. API Endpoint: `/src/app/api/creators/[address]/route.ts`
- Fetches creator data by their primary wallet address
- Returns comprehensive profile information including:
  - Creator details (username, bio, follower count, etc.)
  - All games created by the user
  - Statistics (total games, published games, tokenized games)
- Includes proper error handling and TypeScript types

### 2. Profile Page Route: `/src/app/profile/[address]/page.tsx`
- Dynamic route that accepts wallet address as parameter
- Server-side rendered page with loading states
- Responsive design matching your app's dark theme

### 3. Profile Content Component: `/src/components/profile-content.tsx`
- Complete profile UI with modern, clean design
- Features include:
  - **Profile Header**: Avatar, username, wallet address, power badge
  - **Statistics Grid**: Total games, published games, tokenized games, followers, score
  - **Games Gallery**: Grid layout showing user's created games with status badges
  - **Interactive Elements**: View game buttons, status indicators
  - **Loading States**: Skeleton loading animation
  - **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Design Features

### Modern UI/UX
- **Dark Theme**: Consistent with your app's `#1a1a1a` background
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean separation with `#2a2a2a` cards
- **Color-coded Stats**: Different colors for different metrics
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators for game status (Live, Token)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Technical Features
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with proper interfaces
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Loading States**: Smooth user experience
- **Address Formatting**: Clean display of wallet addresses
- **Date Formatting**: User-friendly date display

## Usage

### Accessing Profile Pages
Users can access profile pages using the URL pattern:
```
/profile/[wallet-address]
```

Example:
```
/profile/0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

### API Integration
The profile page fetches data from:
```
GET /api/creators/[address]
```

This endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "creator": {
    "fid": 123,
    "username": "username",
    "pfp": "profile-image-url",
    "bio": "User bio",
    "primary_address": "0x...",
    "follower_count": 100,
    "following_count": 50,
    "power_badge": true,
    "score": 85
  },
  "builds": [...],
  "stats": {
    "totalBuilds": 10,
    "publishedBuilds": 8,
    "tokenizedBuilds": 3
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Profile Display
- User avatar and username prominently displayed
- Wallet address with proper formatting (truncated display)
- Power badge indicator for verified users
- Bio/description when available

### 2. Rich Statistics
- **Total Games**: Count of all games created
- **Published**: Successfully completed and deployed games
- **Tokenized**: Games that have been tokenized
- **Followers**: Social metrics from Farcaster
- **Score**: User reputation score

### 3. Games Showcase
- Grid layout of all user's games
- Game thumbnails when available
- Status badges (Live for published games, Token for tokenized games)
- Creation dates
- Direct links to view games

### 4. Professional Error Handling
- 404 handling for non-existent users
- Network error handling
- Loading states during data fetching
- Fallback content for missing data

## Integration with Existing System

The profile page integrates seamlessly with your existing:
- **Database Schema**: Uses existing creators, builds, and coins tables
- **Styling System**: Matches your Tailwind CSS design system
- **Component Library**: Uses your existing UI components (Button, Badge)
- **Type System**: Consistent with your existing TypeScript patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Set up environment variables** for Supabase to enable full functionality
2. **Add navigation links** to profile pages from other parts of the app
3. **Implement profile editing** functionality if needed
4. **Add social features** like following/unfollowing users
5. **Optimize images** by replacing `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` components

## Technical Notes

- Built with Next.js 15 App Router
- Uses proper async/await patterns for the new route handlers
- Fully TypeScript typed
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Optimized for performance with proper loading states
- Follows your existing code patterns and conventions

The profile page is now ready for use and provides a comprehensive view of each user's activity and achievements in your Mini Games Studio platform!
